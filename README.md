# Faculty_Portal_Using_Java
In this repo, we created a faculty portal in which it has
1. Option to enter 3 Different marks
2. option to view all the entered marks
3. If you lost any marks you can also view them because they can be saved in your local directory
4. Can give attendance to x students
5. It has 2 user login credentials ( can be added if you want )
